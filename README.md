# Maledives Resort
Maledives Resort - One-Page website project:

live demo: https://maledivesresort.netlify.app/

This is one of my first full-fledged projects completed during Mateusz Maj's web development course. The project shows a one-page version of the website of a resort located in the Maldives. The site consists of several sections and is fully responsive. In the future it will be expanded to include elements such as:

Room booking system
Special events booking system
Confirmation form submission
